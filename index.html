        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there! I am a husband, father of 3, gamer, and Junior Software
          Developer. I like to spend as much time with my family as I can, doing
          whatever it is we all enjoy. I like all manner of video games from
          simple retro games to Elden Ring and Phantasy Star Online. I completed
          TripleTen's Software Engineering Bootcamp program in December 2024. I
          am a natural problem solver who loves software development. I aim to
          be professional, personable, and prompt in everything I do and to
          Never Stop Learning.

            <h3>AHA! Clinic</h3>
            <p>
              This is a full-stack application that uses React+Typescript,
              Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. I developed this project at the
              request of a local non-profit organization that runs a spay/neuter
              clinic. I worked closely with the staff and owner to determine the
              needs of the clinic for daily operations and implemented those
              features into the application. The app allows the staff to manage
              clients, their animals, invoice creation and tracking, and the
              rescue organizations they work with. It is complete with
              role-based access control and user authentication. This full-stack
              application is hosted using Render and MongoDB Atlas for the
              databases. I continue working with the clinic staff to fix bugs
              and ensure that the application continues to meet their needs as
              they arise.

            <h3>What to Wear?</h3>
            <p>
              A full-stack application built with the MERN stack, with the
              custom backend hosted and configured on Google Cloud. It is one of
              the projects curated by TripleTen during their program. The goal
              is for the application to suggest items of clothing to wear based
              on certain weather conditions obtained from a third-party API. The
              user is able to create accounts and add clothing items to their
              profile and the application will return those items if they match
              the suggestion logic. While this project is essentially complete,
              the next and final step is to make the application responsive at
              different screen sizes/resolutions.

            <h3>Pokemon Team Builder</h3>
            <p>
              A frontend application and one of my own design. It is the final
              project of my program at TripleTen. It uses the third-party API,
              PokeAPI, and will include a custom backend in the near future. The
              intended function is to suggest teams of 6 for the Pokemon video
              games based on parameters chosen by the user. As of now, the only
              parameters that can be chosen are certain types in a popup form.
              The application requests a partial set of data from the API and
              shows it on the screen. Once the form is submitted, it sorts
              through this data and randomly returns up to six objects that
              match the types chosen. I intend to complete this application by
              creating the backend for user account creation and team
              configuration storage as well as creating additional popups to
              show more information on each creature. I also intend to extend
              the amount of data gathered to include everything that the API has
              to offer.
