        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there! I am a husband, father of 3, gamer, and new developer. I
          like to spend as much time with my family as I can, doing whatever it
          is we all enjoy. I like all manner of video games from simple retro
          games to Elden Ring and Phantasy Star Online. I started learning
          full-stack development about 9 months ago with TripleTen and their
          Software Engineering Bootcamp program. It has been quite a ride but I
          finished it on December 3rd. I have completed 6 projects through their
          course and will be improving on those along with creating my own
          projects as well. I am entering into my search for a career in
          development and am really looking forward to doing this for a living!

            <h3>What to Wear?</h3>
            <p>
              A full-stack application built with the MERN stack, with the
              custom backend hosted and configured on Google Cloud. It is one of
              the projects curated by TripleTen during their program. The goal
              is for the application to suggest items of clothing to wear based
              on certain weather conditions obtained from a third-party API. The
              user is able to create accounts and add clothing items to their
              profile and the application will return those items if they match
              the suggestion logic. While this project is essentially complete,
              the next and final step is to make the application responsive at
              different screen sizes/resolutions.

            <h3>Pokemon Team Builder</h3>
            <p>
              A frontend application and one of my own design. It is the final
              project of my program at TripleTen. It uses the third-party API,
              PokeAPI, and will include a custom backend in the near future. The
              intended function is to suggest teams of 6 for the Pokemon video
              games based on parameters chosen by the user. As of now, the only
              parameters that can be chosen are certain types in a popup form.
              The application requests a partial set of data from the API and
              shows it on the screen. Once the form is submitted, it sorts
              through this data and randomly returns up to six objects that
              match the types chosen. I intend to complete this application by
              creating the backend for user account creation and team
              configuration storage as well as creating additional popups to
              show more information on each creature. I also intend to extend
              the amount of data gathered to include everything that the API has
              to offer.
